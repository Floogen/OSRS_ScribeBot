# OSRS_ScribeBot
[Reddit Bot] Parses Jagex's news post into Markup that are linked on Reddit.

# How It Works
1. The script is scheduled to check [/r/2007scape/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/new) every minute for new posts with a https://services.runescape.com/m=news/* link.
# Questions?
I commented pretty thoroughly, but some things may be confusing to read even with explanations (especially the regex). However, if you have any questions about how my code works, please do let me know and I'll try to explain where I can. I'd advise Googling your question first however, as that often will answer things faster than I can.

# Notes
